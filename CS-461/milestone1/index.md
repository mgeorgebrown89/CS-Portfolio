### Team Establishment, Project Brainstorming
#### [Requirements](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/t2/M1.html)

For Milestone 1, the main goal was getting into our assigned groups and figuring out communication. 

#### Task 1: Group Name, Motto, Logo, Letterhead, Business Cards
We tossed around a lot of ideas. Currently, our team name is et progressus, which is latin for "development of..."  Our motto is "Continuous Learning." 

Here is a picture of our logo/letterhead:

We chose all this because we were originally thinking we were going to build a study aide application, but we may be changing this soon since we are most likely going a different direction with our project.
