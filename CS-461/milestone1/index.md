### Team Establishment, Project Brainstorming
#### [Requirements](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/t2/M1.html)

For Milestone 1, the main goal was getting into our assigned groups and figuring out communication. 

#### Task 1: Group Name, Motto, Logo, Letterhead, Business Cards
We tossed around a lot of ideas. Currently, our team name is et progressus, which is latin for "development of..."  Our motto is "Continuous Learning." 

Here is a picture of our logo & letterhead:

We chose all this because we were originally thinking we were going to build a study aide application, but we may be changing this soon since we are most likely going a different direction with our project.

#### Task 2: Resumes

For this task, our group had to create new resumes that all had the same look and feel and met specific requirements. I would include a picture of these, but some of it is personal information and if you want to see my resume, go to my [website](https://mgeorgebrown89.github.io/).

#### Task 3: 3 Ring Binder

Our professor wanted hard copies of our work to go over when we met once a week.

#### Task 4: Schedule Metting Hours

Our task was to figure out at least 5 hours during the week when we could meet. I used whenisgood.net to figure out the mutual openings in our class and works schedules and made a chart in Google Sheets.

#### Task 5: Slack Team

I created a Slack team and invited my team members and professor. 

#### Task 6: Bitbucket Repository

We chose one member of our team to be the main repo owner and he set it up on Bitbucket. We started practing the Git Forking Workflow. 

#### Task 7: Three Project Ideas

For this task we needed to come up with three project ideas and write a sentence about each one. Here are our ideas:

```
1. A study aide for people that would incorporate an AI API 
to use a chatbot to quiz them 
and flashcards which would 
use an algorithm to determine how often a card appears based on user feedback.

2. A tool for managing an agile work environment by creating tasks and assigning them to developers.

The tool would utilize and social media and possibly a Git API to manage users and git workflows.

3. A word processor and text editor for writers that uses algorthimic and some AI API to correct spelling, grammar, syntax,
make suggestions for word choice, etc. 
```
