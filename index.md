# Portfolio Home.

Welcome to my portfolio! If you found this, you probably come from my personal website, but just in case, **[here](https://mgeorgebrown89.github.io/)** it is. 

## About Me.

My name is Michael, and I am currently in my final year of the Computer Science program at Western Oregon University.

This portfolio is mostly a showcase of my senior project and all of my work done during the final year of the program, including **CS460**, **CS 461**, and **CS 462**, which included my senior capstone project, both as part of a development team and individually. I will eventually be putting some other write-ups of other projects I've done, both for school and on my own. 

## Showcase.

### [Software Engineering I (CS 460)](CS-460)

### [Software Engineering II (CS 461)](CS-461)

### [Software Engineering II (CS 462)](CS-462)
