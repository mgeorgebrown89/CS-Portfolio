##### [Requirements](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW9.html) 

#### Step 1: Start with Homework 8.

Done.

#### Step 2: Create Remote Database

After creating my account on Azure, I created the database.

I connected to the databse in Microsoft SQL Management Studio and used my up.sql script to see the database.

Then I tested it to see that it worked.

#### Step 3: Deploy Web App

Now I published my hw8 to Azure.

Once it finally deployed, I got the connection string, forgot to edit my username and password, fixed that, and it worked!

#### Step 4: Microsoft Azure Account

This step should probably be the first step, as its impossible to do steps 2 and 3 before creating an account. :)

#### Step 5: Screenshots, Portfolio. 

Got it.
