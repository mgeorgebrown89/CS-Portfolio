Github | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap

For homework 1, we are supposed to create a set of webpages in HTML and CSS, utilizing Bootstrap libraries, all while learning how to use Git. 

### Step 1
I downloaded the Git Bash since we're supposed to do everything from the command line this term (and the whole year). I first created a repository on Github. I don't remember what I originally named it -- I've since changed it several times, finally landing on CS-Repository. I then created my corresponding folder locally 
``` 
    cd ~/Documents
    mkdir CS\ Portfolio
```
and after configuring Git, 
```
    git config --global 

```
