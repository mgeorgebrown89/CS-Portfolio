### Visual Studio | C# | Git

For homework 3, we are supposed to install Visual Studio and begin to familiarize ourselves with the program. We are then supposed to download a Java program, learn what it does, and convert it into C#. 

#### Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio

This was pretty easy. 

#### Step 2: Figure out the Java Postfix calculator

This was a little more diffucult. My java skills were a little rusty, but I figured out after a little while. 

#### Step 3: Replicate this program in C#

Then we need to replicate the calculator in the C# language. This took quite a bit longer. Our professor was emphatic that we not copy and paste the code and try to fix the errors. I mostly typed in everything line by line and where I knew differences needed to be made, I did them right there, otherwise I commented out the Java code and looked up documentation to find other compatible class, etc. 

#### Step 4: Start a new feature branch and include the .gitignore file.

Fortunately, after HW2, I knew how to make a new branch and not get confused by the files disappearing/reappearing, so that part was rather easy. The .gitignore file was included automatically for me (at least I think so at this point).

#### Step 5: Multiple Commits

I may not have committed this often enough to prove I did this from scratch, but I'm not sure what I can do about that now. 

#### Step 6: C# Conventions

We had to make sure we followed all of the conventions for C#, which I believe I did. 

#### Step 7: Inlude your program in your portfolio.

That's what this is.
