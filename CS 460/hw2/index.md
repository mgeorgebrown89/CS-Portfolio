### Git Branch | Merge | Javascript | jQuery | DOM

For homework 2, we are supposed to create another small website, showing that we can do basic Javascript and jQuery while practicing branching with git. 

#### Step 1: Create a New Branch
First, we were supposed to make a new folder named `hw2` and then make a new feature branch there while we work on this homework. Then we were to create an `index.html` and a `styles.css` file. 
```bash
  $ git checkout -b hw2
  Switched to a new branch 'hw2'
```
